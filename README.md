# Proksi: Automatic SSL, HTTP, and DNS Proxy

<img src="./assets/discord.png" alt="discord-logo" width="200"/>


# About

Proksi is a simple, lightweight, and easy-to-use proxy server that automatically handles SSL, HTTP, and DNS traffic. It is designed to be used as a standalone proxy server or as a component in a larger system. Proksi is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and uses [Pingora](https://github.com/cloudflare/pingora) as its core networking library.


# Features

Of the many features Proksi offers is the ability to load balance to your infrastructure or any IP that supports your host configurations. Other features of Proksi also include:

- Automatic Docker and Docker Swarm service discovery through labels
- Built-in most common middlewares such as OAuth, Rate Limiting, CDN Caching and others
- The ability of running it as a single binary in your system
- Automatic SSL through Let's Encrypt and redirection from HTTP to HTTPS
- Configuration through **HCL** with support for functions (get environment variables, etc)
- Powerful plugin system for adding new middlewares and other features using **WebAssembly (WASM)**
- Many others.

# Quick start

1. Download the latest release from [https://github.com/luizfonseca/proksi/releases](https://github.com/luizfonseca/proksi/releases)
2. Create a configuration file named `proksi.hcl`
3. Add the following content to the file:

```hcl
lets_encrypt {
  enabled = true
  email = "my@email.com"
}

paths {
  # Where to save certificates?
  lets_encrypt = "./"
}

# A list of routes Proksi should handle
routes = [
  {
    # You might need to edit your /etc/hosts file here.
    host = "mysite.localhost",

    # Will create a certificate for mysite.localhost
    ssl_certificate =  {
      self_signed_on_failure = true
    }

    # Where to point mysite.localhost to
    upstreams = [{
      ip = "docs.proksi.info"
      port = 443

      headers = {
        add = [{ name = "Host", value = "docs.proksi.info" }]
      }
    }]
  }
]
```
4. Run `proksi -c /path-where-proksi.hcl-is-located`
