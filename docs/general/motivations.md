# Motivations

## Why build another proxy...?

Many reasons, but the main one is that I wanted to learn more about how proxies work, and I wanted to build something that I could use in my own projects.&#x20;

I also wanted to build something that was easy to use and configure, and that could be extended with custom plugins AND offered out-of-the-box things that other projects needed the community to make.

Also, Rust is a very good use case for proxies (lower CPU usage, lower memory usage etc) and Cloudflare Pingora is basically a blueprint that you can create things with.

This project will be used in VPSes and I welcome you to explore and contribute as you wish.
